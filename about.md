I love to collaborate, design useful digital products, create visual identities, draw letters, experiment with code, see new places, and learn new things.

I live in the most interesting city in the world.

I'm a product designer at IBM. So far, I’ve focused primarily on data visualization for internal executive dashboards, a UI for app staging control, and the chat / contact system in the IBM Marketplace. I’ve also had fun and learned a lot from extra-curricular projects, such as a jukebox for SXSW, and an app to highlight IBM Watson for NYCxDesign.
