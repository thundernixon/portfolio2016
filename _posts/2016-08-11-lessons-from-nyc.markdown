<!-- # Any tips for NYC? -->

Hi Stephen,
>
Our mutual friend Alex Simpson gave me your email address. I'm moving to Brooklyn August 15 and currently looking for jobs in advertising/marketing, specifically social media, copywriting or content development. Alex mentioned that you're a graphic designer in New York and that you'd be a great contact to have. I'd really appreciate it if you could share any tips or advice you might have for making it as a creative in NYC.

Thanks!

Hi Holly,

That's awesome you're friends with Alex, too! He's awesome. Do you know him from Minneapolis, Milwaukee, or somewhere else?

Yup, I'm doing software product design for IBM at their Astor Place office. I've been here for what will be two years, in October. I still feel a bit like I just showed up, but I have found out a few useful things in that time:

1. The cost of rent can really suck, but living in an area within walking distance of good places to eat and drink is so valuable to being able to socialize with people on a somewhat spontaneous basis. This can be key, because in this big a city, it can actually be pretty tough to make friends – everyone's on their own orbit, so you'll have the most luck if you set yourself up to intersect with people repeatedly. Case in point: I lived in Prospect Loefferts Gardens last year, and it was a bit out of the way to get to most bars/restaurants/coffee shops I would want to hang out at. This year, I'm just 1.5 miles north, in Crown Heights, and I feel so much better. It's been much quicker to connect with others that live nearby, when chances arrive. Still, there are plenty of places that would be cool to live in, but I just couldn't quite stomach the rent, unless I moved in with a few roommates. Roommates are not a bad idea at all if you can find some people, but I live with my girlfriend and that feels like the right amount of apartment density for the moment). There's a Facebook group called "Jenna's List," I think, that was recommended to me as a possible way to find roommates.

2. If you're looking for a place on your own or with others rather than going the Craigslist roommate route, I've found that StreetEasy is a pretty good way to find apartment listings. I just found a bunch of places that seemed okay, and texted the agents from my computer using lots of copy/pasting, because half of the listings will be gone already. When an agent has one decent listing, it can be worth seeing it, and it might not be great, but they'll be happy to drive you around to see more.

3. Aside from living in a somewhat "younger" area, another key to finding and repeatedly running into people is to seek out a few recurring events in fields you're interested in, and going to them when you can. You'll start to meet some people at these events repeatedly, and even if your busy schedules are hard to connect outside of these events, it'll be good to see them. For instance, I really like type design and typography, so I've met some great people through lectures at Cooper Union and at the Type Director's Club.

4. On the job front specifically, I've heard from a designer in advertising that she thinks it really helped her to apply using an NYC address, and just quickly flying in for an interview. She felt that companies were more comfortable if they felt they weren't gambling on someone's ability to adjust to living in a new place. However, I don't know if that's really the case.

5. My favorite pizza slice place is Prince Street Pizza, in SoHo. My favorite woodfire pizza place is Barboncino, in Crown Heights. My favorite bagel place is Bagelsmith, in Williamsburg. My favorite ramen place is Miso Ya, in the East Village, though I'm still exploring because I feel like there are a couple possible improvements. My favorite taco place is Taquería Diana, right next to Miso Ya. My favorite fast-sushi place is Ennju, just north of Union Square.

6. I'm sure that you probably already know about this, but there are lots of great free things to do here – most museums and gardens are either pay-what-you-want or free at certain points in the week. I can send links to a few lists of these things, I think, if you aren't easily finding them via Google.

There's no doubt loads more I could tell you, but those are a few initial things that come to mind. Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll try to be a bit quicker with the next response! Also, let me know when you're here! I would be happy to meet up, if you'd be interested in that and the times work out.

Best of luck!

Stephen
