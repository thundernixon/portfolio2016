# It was time for an update.

[My prior portfolio](http://thundernixon.com){:target="\_blank"} was fun to build with Wordpress and Sage, but it was clearly  not working.


<em>A few things I learned from my last portfolio: </em>

* Use more pictures, fewer words
* A portfolio post is not a blog post
* It can be a fun design challenge to make a portfolio with a genre-pushing design, but good luck going against the design culture of minimalism when you're trying to get work
